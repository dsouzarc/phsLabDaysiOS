PHSLabDays for iOS

##Background Story
PHSLabDays is a service that sends text reminders to Princeton High School students on their lab days.
Students enter their lab days and reminder preferences on a Google Document Form, which sends their data to a SpreadSheet on Google Drive. 

My program then accesses that spreadsheet and sends text reminders to those who need it.

I originally wrote it as a Java program that could be run from the commandline of my computer. 
However, I did not like having to run the script from my computer.

So, I wrote an Android app that would do it for me. Every morning at 6:30AM, a PHSLabDays notification would popup on my phone and remind me to send a lab day message. Sending a lab day message was as simple as sliding a wheel to the correct letter day and pressing Send. All in all, it was a 15 second process.

However, the Android phone broke and I made the switch to iOS. 

This repository contains the iOS app I will use to send lab day reminders.

What was supposed to be a commandline program turned into an Android app which turned into an iOS app.
